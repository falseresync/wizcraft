# Wizcraft

## Sky Wand and Focuses

Sky Wand is a versatile tool! You can combine it with focuses by having some focuses in your inventory and pressing [LEFT ALT] to cycle through them.

### Charging focus

Every wand comes with a charging focus. Hold [RMB] under the starry skies at night and charge the wand!

### Starshooter focus

Have you ever wanted to shoot stars at your enemies? Now you can! Stars explode your enemy, but don't explode blocks (a.k.a. building-safe :D)

### Lightning focus

Now, how about playing a Zeus? You can do that with Lightning focus! For some charge you can easily shoot lightning left and right!

### Comet Warp focus

Everyone has to venture into a crowd of enemies sometimes. Or to just teleport home without hassle. Use the nifty Comet Warp focus to setup a recall point and then teleport to it from any location or dimension for just some wand charge!

## Lensed Worktable

Craft focuses using a lensed worktable setup: Energized worktable surrounded by 4 lensing pedestals. And don't mess up the order of components on the pedestals!
