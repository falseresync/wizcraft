Magic is the art of channelling energy and reconfiguring substances.


Contrary to popular belief, magic isn't unknowable, holy or cursed, inferior
or superior to any other area of the Minecraftian knowledge. Just as any craft,
technology or art it can be learned.

;;;;;

And it's the goal of Grimoires - the textbooks of magic studies - to introduce
you to the wonders of magical knowledge, to guide you through using magic to
create functional magic tools - the skill we call Wizcraft.
