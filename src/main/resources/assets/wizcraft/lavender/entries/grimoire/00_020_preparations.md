In order to go forth with your exploration of magic, you need to have proper
tooling. While your average Crafting table might suffice for some endeavors,
magic requires something more specialized. 


With that in mind, you might recall the two primary modes of magic: channeling
energy and reconfiguring substances. 

;;;;;

Your tools should be able to accomplish
these two goals.


Therefore, let's start with the simpler part - working with substances. The two
crudest and most essential ways to alter substances are:
- Destructuring using a Mortar and pestle
- Amalgamation using a Crucible

;;;;;

To start, craft yourself a Mortar and a pestle:

Making a crucible is equally simple. First, take your average cauldron, place
it over some source of heat like fire or a campfire, and fill it with water.

Finally, you should be able to use most magical tools to activate it - use your
Grimoire on it, for now.
