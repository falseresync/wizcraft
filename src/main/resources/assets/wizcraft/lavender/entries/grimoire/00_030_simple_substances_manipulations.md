With a Mortar and pestle and a working Crucible (don't turn off the heat!)
you now can continue onto making a tool for the second mode of magic -
channeling energy.


This tool is called a Wand, and it consists of two primary parts - a Metallized
stick to provide a sturdy and durable handle for you to hold onto, and a Wand
core.

;;;;;

The core is responsible for the function of the Wand - it can store a bit
of natural energy in form of Charge and then later channel it through some
device to produce a desired effect.


Let's start with the core. You will need a couple of highly transparent gems,
a material that can hold onto energy and some binder.

;;;;;

Put them into your Mortar and pestle, crush them to a homogenous, viscous
substance, form it into an octahedron for the best durability and channeling
ability balance and let it quickly solidify:

A metallized stick is equally easy to make. You should first dissolve some
copper in your crucible, and then coat a regular stick in it - this will
reinforce it enough for it to be able to serve long and good:

Finally, you can now use some gold, the malleable and workable metal it is,
to gently attach your Wand core onto a metallized stick to get your first
Wand:

Additionally, should you ever lose your Grimoire, you could use a similar
mixture of materials on a regular book to let the universal energy of the
world arrange it into magical knowledge:
